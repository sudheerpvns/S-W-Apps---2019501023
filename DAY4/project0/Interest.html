             <li>Playing Sports:</li>
             <p>Playing sports like cricket and Badminton, it is great way to unwind stress
                 and keep my mind sharp. It also helped me develop team spirit because you 
                 need to part of the team and play as one team to win matches. It also helped 
                 me accept failures. I was part of the team that won MSIT premier league.

                attention to detail and creativity.
